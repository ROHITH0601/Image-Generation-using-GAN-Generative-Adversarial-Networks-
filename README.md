# Image-Generation-using-GAN-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-
This project is focused on generating images using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed for generating new data that is similar to a given dataset. The core idea of a GAN is to pit two neural networks against each other in a game-like scenario: a generator and a discriminator.
